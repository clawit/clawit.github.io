"category": "security",
"content": "Currently passbolt is in “alpha”, which means it is not yet a completely finished product. While we encourage you to try it out, the answer to whether you should store critical information with it depends on your security level requirements.For instance, if your team currently stores its passwords in plaintext, passbolt will definitely be an improvement. Similarly, if you plan to host passbolt in way that it is only accessible on your local machine or network or via a VPN, then the security level is also likely to be appropriate.On the other hand if you have very high security requirements, for example if you are dealing with systems holding credit card information, or if you are a human-rights organisation, you may want to wait before starting using passbolt!In the future we will be publishing a comprehensive risk analysis to give you a complete picture of the threat model.",

"category": "security",
"content": "There are three state of data to consider:  The data in motion (on the wire),  The data in use (in the memory or file system on the server or client side)  The data at rest (on the filesystem when the power is off).For the data in use, it is only passwords that are encrypted. For example, your username, the comments or the list of people you are sharing a password with are not encrypted using OpenPGP, and are stored in plaintext both on the client and server side. Obviously passwords can be available in decrypted form at some point (the later the better), but they will never be stored in plain text on the filesystem on either the client or server side.For the data in motion, e.g. on the transport layer level, all the communication are encrypted using SSL. The strength of the security at that level is not controlled by the passbolt solution itself but rather a combination of other factors such as the level of security of the organization issuing the certificate and the operating system configuration chosen by the hosting provider.For the data at rest, for most of the clients and servers, it is also possible to encrypt the database at the file system level as well. This will add another encryption layer that can be useful, for example, in the case where the machine running passbolt is seized or stolen.",

The browser extension uses OpenPGP, a standard which provides a combination of strong public-key and symmetric cryptography. The private secret key used to decrypt your password is itself encrypted using a passphrase (aka your master password). On the client side passbolt uses OpenPGP.js as a foundation for all its cryptographic functionalities.On the server side passbolt uses both the GnuPG Php Extension and openpgp-php in order to perform public key validation and to support the GPGAuth authentication protocol.

Currently, the recommendation to solve these problems is to use a browser extension. Passbolt follows this recommendation.The other issue has to do with the quality of the javascript implementation of the cryptographic functionalities and the fact that Javascript has its fair share of pitfalls. This is true for any programming languages and can only be addressed through careful code review. Passbolt uses OpenPGP.js for its cryptographic functionalities which have been reviewed multiple times by Cure53.Organizing more regular independent 3rd party audits is one of our main priorities.

The goal of the directory synchronization tool, also called LDAP connector, is to provide a way for a passbolt administrator to synchronize a list of groups and users, as well as the associated group memberships. Currently the connector supports two types of directory: OpenLDAP and Microsoft Active Directory. In the future we will also support other non ldap based user directories such as Google API User Directory. How does it work? In a nutshell this part of the application will try to keep passbolt and a directory in sync with a minimal involvement of the administrators and group managers. However if an action is not possible, such as, deleting a user that is the sole password owner, the process triggers will trigger relevant email notifications so that a...",
