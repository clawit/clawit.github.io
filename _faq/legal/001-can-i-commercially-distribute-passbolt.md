For Passbolt Community Edition you can if you abide by the AGPL license terms! For the Passbolt Pro Edition
you also need to to abide to the Passbolt subscription terms (tldr: pay the fees, have a valid number of users, etc.).

Our goal in selecting the AGPL v3.0, as our default license is to require that the source code is distributed to the 
end users, so that enhancements can be released back to the community. Traditional open source licenses such as GPL 
often do not achieve this when the software is runs as a web application, e.g. as hosted application available 
through a network.

If the AGPL v3 does not satisfy your organisation, an alternative open source license (OSI compatible) can be purchased.
Feel free to contact us for more details.
