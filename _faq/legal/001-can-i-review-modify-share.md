Absolutely. The entire passbolt solution is composed of a free software. Our source code is made available in such a way that all of our users have the rights to:

* Use the software for any purpose,
* Change the software to suit their needs,
* Share the software with their friends and neighbors,
* Distribute the software and the changes they make.

You can learn more about free software on the [free software foundation website](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html).
