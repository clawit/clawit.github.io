At passbolt we are required to have agreement with everyone who submit contributions, in order to make sure 
that we, and the user of our software, are legally entitled to distribute your contributed code anywhere
in the world.

In effect, you still own the copyright but you are giving us a licence. You retain the right to modify your 
code and use it in other projects.
