You do not need to code to be able to help. There are many ways you can support passbolt, we wrote a
[blog post about it](https://medium.com/passbolt/are-you-doing-your-part-5d1b68e12f35).
Feel free to [contact us](mailto:contact@passbolt.com) if you would like to know more about 
sponsorship or volunteering opportunities. 

Here is a quick summary of what you can do:

## Spread the word

Writing a review on [Google Chrome Webstore] or 
[Mozilla Plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/passbolt/reviews/) page can go a long 
way in helping passbolt get noticed. You can also give us a shout on twitter or a star 
on [Github](http://github.com/passbolt/).

If you have a blog, if you are the member of a forum, if you are an editor on a product review site, 
if you are a journalist working on technology and security topics, you can write a review of passbolt.

## Support other users

You can help by answering simple questions on the [community forum](https://community.passbolt.com),
document how to reproduce a bug, etc. You can also publish how-to articles, installation tutorials in 
other languages or propose changes to [this documentation](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_help).

## Contribute to the product

You can help with your [design ideas](/faq/start/design-contribution) 
or with [code](/faq/start/code-contribution).

## Test passbolt releases

We need experienced passbolt administrators to try our development branches to test the new and upcoming 
releases, and propose additional selenium and unit tests scenarios.
You can also organize hallway usability tests and share the results with the community.

## Support passbolt financially

You can support passbolt community as whole by subscribing to the 
[community membership program](https://www.passbolt.com/services/community).

If you have a larger budget you can also sponsor a feature, we will make sure you are in the
front row seats to review the functional requirements and the technical specifications.
