If you have an idea for a new feature you should first try to discuss it with the community on the 
[forum](https://community.passbolt.com/). It is important to make the difference between the problem you 
are trying to solve and the proposed approach, as their can be several approaches to solve the same problem
but also to make sure the changes are useful to most users.

You can help people visualise the proposal with wireframes, design prototypes and users stories. User
stories are an important part of passbolt development cycle as they help us define automated tests and
acceptance criteria for us to call a feature done.

Here is a few example of design documentation we have used in the past:
- [Groups functionality](https://medium.com/passbolt/how-passbolt-will-implement-groups-ee49108a6ff1)
- [Tags design discussion](https://medium.com/passbolt/tags-functionality-b7f70786a0c4)
