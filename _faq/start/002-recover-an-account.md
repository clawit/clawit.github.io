The account recovery functionality can be used if you are setting up a passbolt client on a new machine
because you lost, upgraded, reinstalled the previous one. You can also use this method to configure a
passbolt client on an additional machine.

This procedure can only be completed if you are in possession of an active user account and a copy of the private
key associated with that account.

**Step 1.** In order to recover you will need to go to your domain URL and add `/recover` at the end of the url,
for example `https://yourpassbolt.com/recover`.

**Step 2.** Complete the form by providing your email address.

**Step 3.** Follow the link in your mailbox. 

**Step 4.** Follow the recovery steps, which is much like the initial setup. You will need to import your private key.

**Step 5.** Login!
