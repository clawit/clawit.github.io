## Creating a demo account
Passbolt requires a server to work. You can either [install it on your own]({{ "/hosting/install" | absolute_url }}) machine
or use the demo environment. Here is the procedure to try out the demo:

**Step 1.** Open the demo page: [https://demo.passbolt.com](https://demo.passbolt.com).

**Step 2.** An add-on is required to use passbolt, click on the linke to install the plugin for Firefox or Chrome.

**Step 3.** You will see a small red key icon in the upper right hand corner of your browser. Click on it.

**Step 4.** Select the demo instance. 

**Step 5.** Click the Register button and enter your name and email. Other users will be able to see your email (
this is to allow testing "sharing" functionality), so you can use a throw-away email account if you are not confortable with this.

**Step 6.** Passbolt sent you an email that contains a link allowing you to login.
{% include messages/warning.html
    content="The link is only valid for a short duration (72h by default, but this can be vary).
    If you registration email token expired you can request another one using the recovery feature at `https://[your_passbolt]/recover`"
%}

## Setup the account

**Step 1.** Check your email. When you click this link the setup will start.

**Step 2.** passbolt will ask you to check the URL passbolt is associated with 

{% include articles/figure.html
    url="/assets/img/help/2018/01/url-check.png"
    legend="Validation of the domain"
    width="450px"
%}

**Step 3.** If you recognize the domain name, check the checkbox and then click Next. 

**Step 4.** Passbolt will ask you to create a new key on the following screen:
{% include articles/figure.html
    url="/assets/img/help/2018/01/create-new-key.png"
    legend="creating a new key"
    width="450px"
%}

**Step 5.** Next, passbolt will help you create a new master password. Choose this password wisely, 
it will be the gatekeeper to all your other passwords. 
{% include articles/figure.html
    url="/assets/img/help/2018/01/set-passphrase.png"
    legend="setting a passphrase"
    width="450px"
%}

**Step 6.** Once you have chosen your master password and clicked Next, you will be given the opportunity to 
download your private key. It is highly recommended that you do so!

**Step 7.** The final step is to create a security token. 
Choosing a color and a three character token is a secondary security mechanism that helps you know you are 
logging into a *real* passbolt instance.
