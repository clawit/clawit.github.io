Unfortunately it is not possible to reset your private key passphrase if you do not remember the original. 
Similarly if you have lost your private key and you do not have a backup, you cannot decrypt your passwords anymore.

Sadly, you have lost access to the passwords that you have not yet shared. If you have shared your password with 
somebody you can create a new account and ask them to share your password back with you.

If you canâ€™t remember your passphrase, the best thing to do is to start anew.
