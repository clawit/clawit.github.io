This token is used to prevent malicious web pages to trick you by mimicking passbolt 
dialogs in order to steal your data, e.g. to protect your from phishing attacks. 

{% include articles/figure.html
    url="/assets/img/screenshots/LU_security_token.png"
    legend="example of security token"
    width="340px"
%}

This cue will be shown whenever we ask you for your master password and other sensitive places to help 
make sure you are dealing with an authentic passbolt dialog and not a fake one!
