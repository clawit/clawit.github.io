This tutorial covers the case where you want to upgrade from your passbolt CE v1.x into Passbolt Pro when using docker.

{% include messages/warning.html
    content="**Important:** Please take a full [backup](/hosting/backup-v1) of your passbolt before proceeding with the upgrade. Backup should include passbolt files as well as the database."
%}

The upgrading process is very similar to the one listed in the [ce section](/hosting/upgrade/ce/upgrade-docker-ce.html). The main difference is that Passbolt Pro requires a subscription key to
work.
