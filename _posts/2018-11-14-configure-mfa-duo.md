Passbolt Pro Edition since v2.5 supports Duo as a multi factor authentication option.
Duo is a proprietary solution that is free for up to 10 users, and supports a bundle
of authentication channels (such as HOTP, mobile push, phone calls, etc.) configurable
by the Duo account administrator.

## Security considerations

It is important to enable and setup at least one additional multi factor authentication 
provider in case Duo service becomes temporarily not available.

In order to use Duo authentication the user will need to interact with an iframe
with content served by passbolt. Make sure your users have access to internet or do
not enable this authentication provider if you are running passbolt on a private network
that is not connected to internet.

## Install Duo app

In order to use this authentication provider each of your users will need to install
the Duo mobile app on their phone or tablet.

- [Duo Mobile for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duosecurity.duomobile&hl=en) on google play store.
- [Duo Mobile for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/duo-mobile/id422663827?mt=8) on apple itunes.

## Get a Duo account

If do not have one account, first sign up at [https://signup.duo.com/](https://signup.duo.com/)
Then log in to the Duo Admin panel at [https://admin.duosecurity.com/login](https://admin.duosecurity.com/login)

Configure your Duo policies as required by your organization.

### Add a passbolt application 

In order for passbolt to enable onboarding and authentication of new users with Duo,
you will need to create a passbolt application in Duo.

{% include articles/figure.html
    url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/mfa-duo-admin.png"
    legend="Duo administration"
    width="550px"
%}

When login in Duo Admin panel in the left menu, click on "Applications", then click on 
"Protect an Application". Find the "Web SDK" application and click on "Protect this Application".

Note down the Integration Key, Secret Key, and API Hostname details, as you will need
them to configure the integration.

## Set the configuration in passbolt

You can either configure Duo in passbolt using the user interface, or files or environment variables.
If multiple settings provider are used the settings in the UI will override the one used in files.
Similarly The settings in files will override environment variables.

You will need to generate a random 40 character string to be used as salt, to help
secure your integration.

### Using admin user interface

Since v2.6 a user interface it provided for administrators to setup MFA providers.
Click on "administration" in the top menu, then "multi factor authentication" on the left menu.
You can then enable or disable the Yubikey provider by providing the user id and secret key that
you gathered in the previous steps. Click "save settings" when you are done.

### Using environment variables

<table class="table-parameters">
<thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Variable name</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Type</th>
    </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_MFA_DUO_SALT</td>
        <td>Random salt</td>
        <td>string (40 chars min.)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_MFA_DUO_INTEGRATIONKEY</td>
        <td>Integration key</td>
        <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_MFA_DUO_SECRETKEY</td>
        <td>Secret key</td>
        <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_MFA_DUO_HOST</td>
        <td>Host</td>
        <td>string</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

When you using docker to set these environment variable you can pass them as arguments,
like other variables such as the database name, for example:

```
$ docker run --name passbolt \
             -p 80:80 \
             -p 443:443 \
             -e PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_MFA_DUO_HOST=api-26e9f2fce.duosecurity.com \
             -e etc.
```

### Using config file

In your install directory you can add the following section in `config/passbolt.php`
and replace the 

```
 'plugins' => [
        'multiFactorAuthentication' => [
            'providers' => [
                'totp' => true,
                'duo' => true,
                'yubikey' => false
            ],
            'duo' => [
                'salt' => 'THIS_MUST_BE_AT_LEAST_FOURTY_CHARACTERS',
                'integrationKey' => 'CCCCPRC95FF3FW21FR5SJ',
                'secretKey' => '7tkYNgxxXaGAuv3KWYYqhsJLfIc1NBnHDYC1siNYX',
                'hostName' => 'api-21e9fcfce.duosecurity.com'
            ]
        ]
    ]
]
```

## Setting Duo for a given passbolt user account

Once you have a the Duo integration configured and Duo app installed on your mobile you
can proceed with enabling Duo as provider for your user account. It is important you test
this to make sure the integration works.

your device if this is the first time you are using Duo with this instance. Follow the
instructions provided by Duo and you should be all set.

The next time you try login from a new device, you will be presented with a Duo 
authentication prompt.
