Passbolt Pro provides a virtual appliance in OVA format. Users can import this appliance on their private virtualization platform and start enjoying Passbolt Pro.
The VM includes the following software:
- Debian 9.6
- Nginx
- Php-fpm
- Mariadb
- Passbolt Pro preinstalled
- certbot
- haveged to fill the entropy pool faster
- Scripts to easy managing SSL setup of the VM

## 1. Getting started with Passbolt Pro VM

### 1.1 Download

Download the ova and the SHA512SUM.txt:

- [Passbolt Pro VM](https://www.passbolt.com/pro/download/vm/debian/latest)
- [SHA512SUM.txt](https://www.passbolt.com/pro/download/vm/debian/latest-checksum)

Import the ova file using virtualbox, vmware or any other platform that supports OVA files.

Once imported into users should be able to boot the VM and just point to the VM ip address with their web browser to initiate the passbolt install process.
However it is encouraged that users log in the VM and start the SSL setup proces.

```bash
VM login credentials:
username: passbolt
password: admin
```

The appliance comes with a example empty database to quickly test Passbolt Pro. However it is encouraged to change password for this database:

```bash
Database default credentials:
database name: passbolt
username: passbolt
password: passbolt
```

### 1.2. SSL setup process:

**Important note:** It is recommended to run the SSL setup before running the installation wizard to avoid secrets to be transmitted unencrypted during the installation process.

Passbolt Pro provides a set of ssl scripts to easily setup SSL. This scripts are located in:
```bash
/home/passbolt/passbolt_ssl_setup/passbolt_pro_debian_ssl_installer.sh
```

Executing the following command the script will guide you through the SSL setup:
```bash
$ sudo /home/passbolt/passbolt_ssl_setup/passbolt_pro_debian_ssl_installer.sh
```

## 2. Configure passbolt

Before you can use the application, you need to configure it. Point your browser to the hostname / ip where passbolt can
be reached. You will reach a getting started page.

{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/web-installer-getting-started.png" legend="passbolt welcome page before configuration" width="586px" %}

Two options are available: **Manual configuration** and **Wizard configuration**. Choose Wizard configuration.

This tutorial will guide you through the different steps of the wizard. The manual configuration is not
covered in this article.

{% assign stepNumber = 1 %}
### 2.{{ stepNumber }}{% assign stepNumber = stepNumber | plus:1 %}. Healthcheck

The first page of the wizard will tell you if your environment is ready for passbolt. Solve any issues and click on
"Start configuration" when ready.

{% if product == 'pro' %}
{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/web-installer-pro-healthcheck.png" legend="wizard - healthcheck" width="586px" %}
{% else %}
{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/web-installer-ce-healthcheck.png" legend="wizard - healthcheck" width="586px" %}
{% endif %}

{% if product == 'pro' %}
### 2.{{ stepNumber }}{% assign stepNumber = stepNumber | plus:1 %}. Subscription key

At this step, the wizard will ask you for your subscription key. You should have received it by email soon after your online purchase.
Enter it in the box.

{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/web-installer-pro-subscription-key.png" legend="wizard - subscription key" width="586px" %}
{% endif %}

### 2.{{ stepNumber }}{% assign stepNumber = stepNumber | plus:1 %}. Database

This step is about telling passbolt which database to use. Enter the host name, port number, database name, username and password.

{% if product == 'pro' %}
{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/web-installer-pro-database.png" legend="wizard - database" width="586px" %}
{% else %}
{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/web-installer-ce-database.png" legend="wizard - database" width="586px" %}
{% endif %}

### 2.{{ stepNumber }}{% assign stepNumber = stepNumber | plus:1 %}. GPG key

In this section you can either generate or import a GPG key pair. This key pair will be used by passbolt API to authentify itself during the
authentication handshake process.

Generate a key if you don't have one.

{% if product == 'pro' %}
{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/web-installer-pro-server-key-generate.png" legend="wizard - generate a key pair" width="586px" %}
{% else %}
{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/web-installer-ce-server-key-generate.png" legend="wizard - generate a key pair" width="586px" %}
{% endif %}

Import a key if you already have one and you want your server to use it.

{% if product == 'pro' %}
{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/web-installer-pro-server-key-import.png" legend="wizard - import a key pair" width="586px" %}
{% else %}
{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/web-installer-ce-server-key-import.png" legend="wizard - import a key pair" width="586px" %}
{% endif %}

### 2.{{ stepNumber }}{% assign stepNumber = stepNumber | plus:1 %}. Mail server (SMTP)

At this stage, the wizard will ask you to enter the details of your SMTP server.

{% if product == 'pro' %}
{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/web-installer-pro-email.png" legend="wizard - smtp mail server details" width="586px" %}
{% else %}
{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/web-installer-ce-email.png" legend="wizard - smtp mail server details" width="586px" %}
{% endif %}

You can also test that your configuration is correct by using the test email feature at the right of your screen. Enter
the email address at which you want the wizard to send you a test email and click on "Send test email".

{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/04/wizard-test-email.png" legend="wizard - test smtp settings" width="300px" %}

### 2.{{ stepNumber }}{% assign stepNumber = stepNumber | plus:1 %}. Preferences

The wizard will then ask you what preferences you prefer for your instance of passbolt. The recommended defaults are already pre-populated
but you can also change them if you know what you are doing.

{% if product == 'pro' %}
{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/web-installer-pro-options.png" legend="wizard - preferences" width="586px" %}
{% else %}
{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/web-installer-ce-options.png" legend="wizard - preferences" width="586px" %}
{% endif %}

### 2.{{ stepNumber }}{% assign stepNumber = stepNumber | plus:1 %}. First user creation

You need to create the first admin user account. This first admin user is probably you, so enter your details and click on next.

{% if product == 'pro' %}
{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/web-installer-pro-first-user.png" legend="wizard - first user" width="586px" %}
{% else %}
{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/web-installer-ce-first-user.png" legend="wizard - first user" width="586px" %}
{% endif %}

### 2.{{ stepNumber }}{% assign stepNumber = stepNumber | plus:1 %}. Installation

That's it. The wizard has now enough information to proceed with the configuration of passbolt. Sit back and relax for a few seconds while
the configuration process is going on.

{% if product == 'pro' %}
{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/web-installer-pro-install.png" legend="wizard - installation" width="586px" %}
{% else %}
{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/web-installer-ce-install.png" legend="wizard - installation" width="586px" %}
{% endif %}

Your user account is now created. You will see a redirection page for a few second and then will be redirected
to the user setup process so that you can configure your user account.

{% if product == 'pro' %}
{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/web-installer-pro-completed.png" legend="wizard - completion and redirection" width="586px" %}
{% else %}
{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/web-installer-ce-completed.png" legend="wizard - completion and redirection" width="586px" %}
{% endif %}

## 3. Configure your administrator account

### 3.1. Download the plugin

Before continuing passbolt will require you to download its plugin. If you already have it installed you can go to the
next step.

### 3.2. Check the server identity

Passbolt will ask you to check the URL passbolt is associated with.

If you recognize the domain name, check the checkbox and then click "Next". It is a formality here, but it is a security
mesure that will help later your users to identify you passbolt instance.

{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/01/url-check.png" legend="Validation of the domain" width="450px" %}

### 3.3. Create a new key

Passbolt will ask you to create or import a key that will be later use to identify you and encrypt your passwords.

{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/plugin-registration-key-generate.png" legend="Generate a key" width="450px" %}

### 3.4. Choose a password

Your key needs to be protected by a password. Choose it wisely, it will be the gatekeeper to all your other passwords.

{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/01/set-passphrase.png" legend="setting a passphrase" width="450px" %}

### 3.5. Backup your key

This step is essential. Your key is the only way to access your account and passwords. If you lose this key (by breaking
or losing your computer and not having a backup for example), your encrypted data will be lost even if you remember your
passphrase.

{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/plugin-registration-backup.png" legend="backup your key" width="450px" %}

### 3.6. Define your security token

Choosing a color and a three character token is a secondary security mechanism that helps you to mitigate phishing
attacks. Each time you are performing a sensitive operation on passbolt, you should see this token.

{% include articles/figure.html url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/plugin-registration-security-token.png" legend="define your security token" width="450px" %}

### 3.6. That's it!

Your administrator account is configured. You will be redirected to the login page of passbolt. Enjoy!
