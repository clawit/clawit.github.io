## Where to find the latest release version number?

You can find information about which version is the latest in the [release notes](<?php echo Router::url('/release/notes',true); ?>). It is generally a good idea to check these notes before running an update. You can also find it on the official [GIT repository](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_api/blob/master/app/Config/version.php).

## Where to find the version number for a given installation?

You can check `app/Config/version.php` to know the version number for your local instance. You can also hover on the _<span class="visuallyhidden">heart</span>_ icon at the bottom right corner of any passbolt screen. The first item is the server version, the second the one from the browser extension.
