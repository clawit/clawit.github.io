This is a maintenance for both Passbolt Pro and Community edition. It fixes issues reported by 
the [community](https://community.passbolt.com/) such as the vulnerability reported by Matthias vd 
Meent, considering the use of an 
unsecure pseudo random number generator when generating passwords. You can learn more about the 
issue on the dedicated [incident page](https://www.passbolt.com/incidents/20180508_password_generator_prng).

This release fixes the issue related to the share autocomplete that was not working for groups 
where the name was two letter long. This release also offers better feedback to help deal with 
server side errors at login.

It also includes an important upgrade of the core library used for the cryptographic operations 
[OpenPGP.js](https://github.com/openpgpjs/). This upgrade will allow passbolt to support 
Public-key cryptography using elliptic 
curves. We will first need to test this out in detail before rolling it out, to make sure the 
limitations are clearly documented especially when it comes to the integration with GnuPG.
