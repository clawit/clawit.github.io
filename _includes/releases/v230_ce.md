This release introduces a much [awaited improvement](https://community.passbolt.com/t/as-an-admin-while-deleting-a-user-who-is-the-sole-owner-of-a-password-that-is-shared-i-should-be-able-to-transfer-the-ownership-to-another-user-in-order-to-be-able-to-perform-the-deletion/45)
which now allows when deleting a user to transfer blocking permissions. This release brings a few small user interfaces
and  improvements, such as placeholder labels when something, like the resource description, is empty.
