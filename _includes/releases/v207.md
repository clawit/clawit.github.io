This release fixes issues introduced by the v2.0.5 both in the webextension and in the API. As you can see 
version v2.0.6 is skipped in the history because it was used as quickfix to revert the breaking 
changes with login when running API version < 1.6.10.

Please note that the version 1 will reach end of life by the end of the month. Make sure you 
update your instance before the end of the month. This will allow us to drop the support for 
the legacy v1 API in passbolt version 2 and makes the rollout of new features easier.
