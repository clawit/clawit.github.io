**Please note that Passbolt API V1.x will be officially unmaintained from 1st of September 2018. If you havenâ€™t upgraded to V2.x yet, it is strongly advised to do it now since the next versions of the browser extension will not be compatible anymore with V1.x branch.**

This release is mainly a maintenance release that also prepares the groundwork for the upcoming ldap feature.

This release also includes a [long awaited fix](https://community.passbolt.com/t/fix-performance-issue-on-large-password-database-2k-4k-passwords/493) regarding performance issues. You can now manage thousands of passwords inside passbolt pretty smoothly.

The security has been improved even more with the implementation of [CSRF](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)) protection. Now each request made by the client contains a token that is verified server side, hence protecting against CSRF attack types. 

We have also upgraded canjs to version 4: It is the framework behind our javascript UI. This upgrade was long due and took quite a bit of efforts. After CakePHP 3.x, the upgrade of canjs is part of these invisible and painful but necessary upgrades that contribute to keep passbolt secure and maintainable.
