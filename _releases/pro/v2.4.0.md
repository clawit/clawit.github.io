We have argued in the past that the current authentication scheme already supported multiple factor: 
something your know (the passphrase) and something you got (the secret key and email activation link for new setup).
Today we can all stop arguing as an additional authentication factor using TOTP (Google Authenticator, 
Authy, FreeOTP). Head to your profile to enable it!

We will be adding support for additional factors such as Yubikey or Duo in the following 
weeks, as well as more administrator features to get usage reports and enforce multiple factor authentication 
for all passbolt users.
