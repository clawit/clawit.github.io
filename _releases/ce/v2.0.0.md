 This is not an April fool! Passbolt v2.0.0 is ready and available for download.

Kindly note that this is a major version release. If you are still running on the v1.x branch, 
you will need to follow a specific [upgrade procedure]({{ "/hosting/upgrade" | absolute_url }}).

The main aspect of this release is the upgrade of the passbolt api code base to CakePHP v3. 
It also ships with improvements such as a simplified configuration system, a better XSS protection 
and more tolerant validation rules. See the full list below.

This release is a complete rewrite of passbolt server component. We now have a code that is better 
organised, easier to read and simpler to maintain. Donâ€™t just take our word for it: this new code 
base has been audited by CakeDC, the experts behind CakePHP. Check out the result of this independent 
3rd party [code review](https://medium.com/passbolt/passbolt-api-code-review-results-8bf1efd2ff05).
