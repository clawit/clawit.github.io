This release was mainly about bug fixes. Also, thanks to an article in the awesome magazine LinuxFR
more people are trying to install passbolt on their own machine, so we published a new page containing updated 
installation instructions. 

### Passbolt API
#### Added improvements

- PASSBOLT-1495: Update installation instructions in README file.

### Passbolt Firefox Add-on
#### Fixed bugs

- PASSBOLT-1408: As a LU I should see the email addresses of the people I'm sharing a password with.
