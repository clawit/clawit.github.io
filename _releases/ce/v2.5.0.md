{% include releases/v250_part1.md %}

This release greatly simplifies the passbolt [installation](https://help.passbolt.com/hosting/install) process. 
It ships with automated scripts for your favorite distributions (Debian 9, CentOS 7 and Ubuntu 18.04) that 
will perform the heavy lifting of the server configuration for you. These scripts will configure a vanilla 
operating system to be ready for a passbolt install.

They take care of setting up the web server (Nginx), database (MariaDb), PHP, SSL and yes, for real, also the 
GPG keyring configuration. In addition to the install scripts, passbolt can now be configured in a few clicks 
thanks to the presence of a web installer. Overall, the new installation process takes no more than 10 minutes!
