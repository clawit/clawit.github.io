This week we rolled out a new homepage as you may have noticed. We also revamped the password 
workspace when no password are present. The nest illustration you can now see in place of the 
original void is a courtesy of our beloved Arthur Duarte. [Check out his work](https://www.behance.net/arthurcduarte).

A big thank you to last week testers: Wout, Gerald, Yann and Diego! We are getting a lot of 
valuable feedback each week, please keep it coming!
