### Passbolt API
#### Improved
- PASSBOLT-2950: Display empty feedbacks content.
- PASSBOLT-2971: Reset the workspaces filters when a resource or a user is created.

- Route rewriting of the appjs should take in account passbolt installed in a subdirectory.
- Fix the loading bar stuck in the initialization state in some cases.
- PASSBOLT-2969: Enforce steal to load the latest version of the appjs.
